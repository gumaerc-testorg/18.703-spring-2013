## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course *18.703 Modern Algebra* as it was taught by Prof. James McKernan in Spring 2013.

This is a first course in abstract algebra. The focus of the course is on traditional algebra topics that have found the greatest application in science and engineering, as well as in mathematics.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

Students will learn the definition and basic properties of groups, permutation groups, groups of small order, cosets, Lagrange's theorem, the classification of finite abelian groups, normal subgroups, quotient groups, simple groups and the Sylow Theorems. Students will also learn the definition of rings, basic properties of rings, ideals, quotient rings, integral domains, fields of fractions, unique factorization domains and principal ideal domains, and the classification of finite fields.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### Lecture

- Met 2 times per week for 1.5 hours per session; 24 sessions total.
- The final exam was held during Finals Week, in one 3-hour session.

### Out of Class

- {{% resource_link "d526b275-1005-cc6f-c022-f7e724fc44b5" "Read the assigned sections" %}} in the textbook
- Work on {{% resource_link "204c5d62-df99-e26a-614d-c66e5cfbe449" "homework assignments" %}}
- Study for the {{% resource_link "7e3bc46b-f99c-8496-994d-4c3a17426de4" "exams" %}}
